        <h2>COVID-19: UK reports 78,610 new coronavirus cases - highest daily figure since start of pandemic</h2>
        <p>A further 4,671 cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed - bringing the total to 10,017. Today's figure includes
        some additional cases from yesterday, which were not recorded at the time "due to a data issue that is now resolved".</p>
        <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) added: "A change to the case definition also contributes to the rise in Omicron
        cases we see today."
        
        In the latest 24-hour period where figures are available, another 774 COVID patients were admitted to hospitals in the
        UK - with the total now 7,673, including 896 on ventilators.</p>
        <p>This is slightly up from the same time the previous week when 738 patients were admitted.
        
        Meanwhile, yesterday 34,082 people received their first dose of a vaccine, while 37,888 were given a second. This means
        46,842,497 people have received two jabs so far, equivalent to 81.5% of the population.
        
        And 656,711 booster or third jabs were administered bringing the UK total to 24,732,162 people - equivalent to 43% of
        the population</p>
